# ✈️ Flight Price Prediction Web Application

---

## 📌 Project Overviews

The **Flight Price Prediction Web Application** is an end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts flight ticket prices based on user inputs such as **source city, destination city, number of stops, journey duration, airline, and travel date**.

The project integrates **Machine Learning**, **Flask backend**, and **HTML/CSS frontend**, and is **fully deployed on Render** for real-time usage

## 📊 Model Training

The model was trained in **Jupyter Notebook**, including:

* Data cleaning
* Feature engineering
* Handling categorical variables
* Model training & evaluation
* Model serialization using `joblib`

The trained model is stored as:

```
model/Flight_Price_Prediction.pkl
```

---

## ⚠️ Validation & Error Handling

* ❌ Same source and destination city not allowed
* ❌ Invalid stop selection handled safely
* ❌ Unseen categories prevented during prediction

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

* Add more airlines and routes
* Improve UI with JavaScript
* Add API endpoint support
* Dockerize application
* Deploy on AWS / GCP
